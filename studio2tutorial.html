<h1>Module 2: Using Studio 2.0 for Planning</h1>

<p>Studio is a <strong>CAD (Computer Aided Design)</strong> tool specifically made to help builders <strong>plan</strong> a certain creation, like a MOC, before ordering parts and building it in real life. 
    For FLL, it helps students share their ideas without having to build something in real life first. Just imagine if you had to take apart your entire tool just to make a simple 
    change! That would be strenuous, and doesn't yield <strong>results</strong> unless you are very experienced. In short, Studio is a designing tool optimized for efficiency.
</p>

<h2>Download Studio 2.0</h2>

<p>If you haven't already, download Studio for your device using this link below to the direct Bricklink site.</p>
<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page" target="_blank" class="linkbutton">Download Studio 2.0</a>
<p>Simply follow Bricklink's download button, and you should have Studio downloading. Once downloaded, click on the "Downloads" button at the top right of your browser and click on the most recent download to open the package. 
    Unfortunately, Studio doesn't work on certain devices, and a desktop is highly recommended.
</p>

<h2>Creating Your First CAD File</h2>

<p>After opening Studio and setting everything up for it (with the help of Bricklink) you should see a menu to the left of your window that looks like this:</p>
<img src="module2image1.png" class="rounded-image">
<p>Click on "Create New". For now, don't worry about creating an account for Studio, as we'll save anything that comes after this in a folder on Google Drive.</p>

<h2>Your Studio Workspace</h2>

<p>You will see a screen with a platform to place bricks on, various menus, and some tools at the top left of the window.</p>
<img src="module2image2.png" class="rounded-image">
<p>This is going to be your Studio <strong>Workspace</strong>, where you'll be able to build your idea and work on the <strong>planning</strong> section of the Engineering Design Process. 
    Thankfully, there are some <strong>tools</strong> within the workspace that will help you do just that.
</p>

<h2>Important Settings</h2>

<p>Before we learn about adding bricks, ensure:</p>

<ul class="normalul">
    <li>
        You have selected "INSERT". This enables you to <strong>add</strong> parts.
        <img src="module2image3.png" class="rounded-image">
    </li>

    <li>
        Your window for Studio is in full screen mode.
    </li>

    <li>
        If you are building with SPIKE Prime specifically (for FLL) you can switch between the "45678-1 SPIKE Prime Set" option and "Main". 
        <img src="module2image4.png" class="rounded-image">
    </li>

</ul>

<p>If you cannot do the last bullet point, it means you do not have the SPIKE Prime set installed onto Studio. In order to access special parts, specifically from certain sets, you <strong>need</strong> to import them. 
</p>

<h2>Adding a Set (SPIKE Prime) to Studio</h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>

<p>Click on "Import LEGO Sets". This enables Studio to add a package to your workspace.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>

<p>Now, you'll get welcomed by a screen that might look something like the image below. You want to focus on the search bar.</p>

<img src="module2image6.png" class="rounded-image">

<h3>Step 3</h3>

<p>Enter in "45678" and you should be able to add in the SPIKE Prime kit after seeing this:</p>

<img src="module2image7.png" class="rounded-image">

<h3>Step 4</h3>

<p>Click on "Import as Palette".</p>
<img src="module2image8.png" class="rounded-image">

<h3>Congratulations! You've Added The SPIKE Prime Set!</h3>

<h2>Placing Your First Part</h2>

<p>There are a variety of ways to add parts onto your Studio Workspace, but it ultimately depends on what you feel is most intuitive.</p>

<h3>Using the Search Bar</h3>

<p>This is what the search bar looks like.</p>

<img src="module2image10.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>For instance, this is a search for a "Technic, Liftarm Thick 1x15". This is what pops up.</p>

<img src="module2image11.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>Now, you can <strong>drag</strong> the icon for the first part into the workspace to add it.</p>

<img src="module2image12.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>You've just added a part into your Studio Workspace. Great job!</p>
